The Fibonacci Sequence is an infinite series that begins with 0, 1, 1,
and then each successive integer is the sum of the previous two integers.

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55


Create a function that takes a parameter and sums all of the even
numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence up to and including the parameter.

Examples:

FibSum(5) = 2
FibSum(8) = 10
FibSum(9) = 10

FibSum(20) = 10

FibSum(36) = 44
